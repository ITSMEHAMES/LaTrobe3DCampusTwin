This is the Latrobe 3D Campus Digital Twin summary and installation read me file.

Project Summary:
The La Trobe 3D Campus Digital Twin is a virtual representation of La Trobe University’s Bundoora campus. The project extends an existing prototype into a more interactive and immersive platform, accessible via web browser and VR headsets. Users can explore the campus through a 2D bird’s-eye map with clickable markers that display detailed 3D building models and related information. The platform is designed with modern web technologies (React, Node.js, Three.js/Fiber, GSAP) and aims to provide a professional, realistic, and scalable digital experience of the campus.
