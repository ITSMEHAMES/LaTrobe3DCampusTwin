Project Summary

The La Trobe 3D Campus Digital Twin (Web App) is an interactive platform that allows users to explore La Trobe University’s Bundoora campus virtually. The application provides a 2D bird’s-eye map with clickable markers that display 3D models of campus buildings, along with contextual information.

The project is developed using Next.js as the primary web framework, combined with React, Three.js/Fiber for rendering 3D models, and GSAP for smooth animations. This ensures scalability, modularity, and strong performance for both development and deployment.
